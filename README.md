# Java8Training
Personal Repository for Java 8 Training. Contains a bunch of scribble code to try and understand:
1. Lambda Functions
2. Stream API and Collectors
3. Time and Date API
4. Strings, IO and other bits and pieces.

I am following the Pluralsight course called "What's New in Java 8" by Jose Paumard
